# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Installing pnpm

We'll be using pnpm as the package manager: https://pnpm.io/installation

Run this command from an elevated command prompt (Run powershell as administrator):

```bash
iwr https://get.pnpm.io/install.ps1 -useb | iex
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install` (or `npm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
# or
pnpm vite
```

## Front-End Development

Strictly use **Flexbox**. For uniformity and ease of development for everyone.
